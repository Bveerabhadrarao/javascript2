JavaScript enhances Web pages with dynamic and interactive features
JavaScript runs in client software.

--->var is used for variable declaration in JavaScript.

The var is function scoped, much like variables declared using the var keyword...


--->let is used for variable declaration in JavaScript. 
The let is block scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword
The let keyword was introduced in the later version of JavaScript known as ES6(ES2015). And it's the preferred way to declare variables.


--->const is used for variable declaration in JavaScript.
Much like variables declared using the const keyword.
The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator).
It can't be redeclared (i.e. through a variable declaration).
If a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

--->if any any two numbers given by seperate variable we can use the parseInt key word like (parseInt(var)+parseInt(var))
--->
we have 3 kind of declaring the variables.
1)var(global scope variable)(it can be use any were in the page)
2)let--(t varible these are all the block level)(re declaration is not possible in this declaration)it is possible wen you intilize b=30 not let b=20 and it is called as block scope variable
3)const--we never use the redeclarization and re intilization of the variable is called the const


Functions
--->function keyword and function name(arg1,arg2,...arg3)
{
   statement
   return--optional
   normal function with no arguments
}
Anonymousfunction:- it  is a function witout having name

Arrow functions
=>no function keyword
after function name keep with =

setTimeout() function
callback function is a function of an argument inside the another function


---->line by line execution is called synchronous
---->otherwise asynchronous(some time wait and some time execute)
